      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I am a student in the collegiate academy and I am currently in Web Design||. I've learned how to code using Github and Code Pen and how to build web pages. 
  I observed all the different types of web pages and learned all the different types of codes that have been used to build a certain website, and I 'm still learning new things along the way. My Professor Mr. Rodriguez assisted me along the way and showed me how to be efficient with all of my work. All this has been a new experience for me for the most part and it was quite fun and I'm thankful to be here.</p>
